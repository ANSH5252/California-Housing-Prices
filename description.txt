ðŸ’¾ Dataset Feature Descriptions 
1. longitude
    â†’ Geographic coordinate that shows how far west or east the property is located.

    â€¢ Lower (more negative) = further west (closer to Pacific Ocean).

    â€¢ Example: -124.3 is more west than -121.5.

2. latitude
    â†’ Geographic coordinate that shows how far north or south the property is.

    â€¢ Higher values = further north.

    â€¢ Example: 38.5 is more north than 33.9.

3. housingMedianAge
    â†’ The median age (in years) of all houses in a block.

    â€¢ A lower number means newer homes.

    â€¢ Example: 5 means half the houses are newer than 5 years, half older.

4. totalRooms
    â†’ Total number of rooms (bedrooms + other rooms) in all houses within a housing block.

    â€¢ Not per house, but sum for the whole block.

5. totalBedrooms
    â†’ Total number of bedrooms only in the housing block.

7. households

8. medianIncome
    â†’ Median annual income of households in the block (in tens of thousands USD).

    â€¢ 6.2 = $62,000

9. medianHouseValue
    â†’ Median market value of homes in the block (in US dollars).

    â€¢ Target variable for prediction in housing price models.

10. oceanProximity
    â†’ Categorical value showing how close the block is to the ocean.

    â€¢ Examples:

        â€¢ 'NEAR OCEAN'

        â€¢ 'INLAND'

        â€¢ 'ISLAND'

        â€¢ 'NEAR BAY'

        â€¢ '<1H OCEAN' (less than 1 hour from ocean)
